  title: The Web's Grain
  url: http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/
  excerpt: "*“I believe every material has a grain, including the web. But this assumption
    flies in the face of our expectations for technology. Too often, the internet
    is cast as a wide-open, infinitely malleable material.”*"

  title: What Screens Want 2013
  url: http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/
  excerpt: "“A designer’s work is not only about how the things look, but also their
    behaviors in response to interaction, and the adjustments they make between their
    fixed states. In fact, designing the way elements adapt and morph in the in-between
    moments is half of your work as a designer. You’re crafting the interstitials.”"
